# jsculator

The idea it's to make a fully functional calculator using the most *pure* JavaScript possible trying to don't use CSS or HTML (just using the needful sir).

## Tasks

[ ] Make the visible part;
[ ] Make a simple calculator;
[ ] Make a scientific calculator;
[ ] Make a graphical calculator;
[ ] Extras (?);
[ ] Make it look good (not necessary).

## Why?

I'm in school learning JavaScript. It's a way to study kinda.
